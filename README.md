# Uber_Data_Analysis
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Uber ride data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It identifies trends across time, location, and trip volume. Visualizations and statistical summaries reveal key insights into user behavior, peak demand hours, and geographic patterns to support data-driven transportation analysis.
